            <h2>History</h2>
            <p className="orangeColor">
              Established in the late 1960s, our family owned business is based
              in Edinburgh and Falkirk, but services customers across the UK.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Edinburgh branch has the longest history as an audio retailer
              in the UK. During recent renovations, receipts were found from
              Nicolson's Gramophone Saloon dating back to 1926. In the 1950s WG
              Graham took over the shop and renamed it WG Graham's HiFi Corner.
              Upon his retirement, Graham Tiso bought the business and
              modernized the name to HiFi Horizon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon thereafter a young enthusiastic Colin MacKenzie (left), who
              was recommended by Linn's own Ivor Tiefenbrun, was employed to
              manage the shop; with a knack for business and years of experience
              in the hi-fi industry, Colin would later become the owner of HiFi
              Horizon. Today, Struan MacKenzie carries on the legacy as the
              company's Managing Director.{" "}
